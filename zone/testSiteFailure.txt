To test a site failure:

Troubleshooting Sharded Clusters: All Members of a Shard Become Unavailable:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/troubleshoot-sharded-clusters/#all-members-of-a-shard-become-unavailable
If zone 2 goes down, you can still query zone 1, *if* it's a targeted query.
Generic scatter-gather queries will produce an error:
"encountered non-retryable error during query: caused by: Could not find host matching read preference (mode: "primary") for set shard01".
Queries targeted at the available shards (using the *full* compound shard key) will continue processing queries (including writes).

To test: 

1. Launch the cluster and perform all steps, up through loading the minimal sample data records. 

2. Simulate a site failure: 

     mlaunch kill shard02

3. Log in to the mongosh:

     mongosh --port 27017

4. Run queries to examine the data. For example, with site 2 down:

     # A scatter-gather query fails:
     db.sensorData.find()

     # A scatter-gather query on partial shard key fails.
     # Investigating whether this should be the case?
     db.sensorData.find( {"metadata.site": "site1"} )

     # A targeted query on site 1 succeeds:
     db.sensorData.find( {"metadata.site": "site1", "metadata.sensorID": "sensorABC"} )

     # This option should also return results but currently does not:
     # https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/cursor.allowPartialResults/
     # https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOSH-1577
     db.sensorData.find( {"metadata.site": "site1"} ).allowPartialResults()

5. Recover the site and verify things are fully operational:

     mlaunch start shard02
